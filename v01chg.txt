Created new Player Class, inheriting from ursina's native Entity class.

Added escape button function, which kills the app. Probably upgraded in future
versions to a "Do you want to quit" pop-up.

Translated movement system inside the Player Class. Probably moving the Class
to a separated file in future versions.

Created new Wall class, similar to Player base class.

Further experimentation in collision handling required. Probably needing ray
tracing or something like that to limit movement manually.
